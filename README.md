### Droplet Size Detection

This project focuses on enhancing image details and detecting edges using Python and OpenCV. It applies several image processing techniques, including unsharp masking to sharpen details, adaptive thresholding Gaussian blurring to reduce noise, and Canny edge detection to highlight edges. The script processes an input image and displays the enhanced output, making it useful for tasks like feature extraction and image analysis.

## Steps to run the project
- Clone the repository and switch to the repository to run the project. It gives the droplet sizing of drop1.jpg

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnjithaVinod/Droplet-Sizing.git
